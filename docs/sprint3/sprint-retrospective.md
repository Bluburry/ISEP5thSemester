## Overall

Overall, this sprint didn't went as well as it could have been, thanks to burn-out and lack of capability to work. We maintain the same mentality of task attribution and execution, we maintain the same comunication levels as the previous sprints, and delivered everything on time and didn't miss anything. The biggest issue was only the time on which this project was delivered. It was very close to the deadline thanks to last minute issues resolution and the previous problems stated.

In terms of final product, the presentation and user experience got a lot better. The team focus on improving the functionalities implementations and allow their utilization to be more intuitive. In our opinion, we succeded in our goal, but we do understand it could have more functionalites and more implementation solely dedicated to the user experience, but thanks to lack of time, we only created what the client asked.

In terms of code, we realized it is not to our liking. The way everything is implemented could be improved if we could do it with no restriction. The major issue that we found, was the persistence of functionalites if new ones are implemented. This can be mostly thanked to the lack of time mentioned previously, but its also specially true because of the specific requirements of the client (rules in terms of code organization). We are aware that this happened because its a college project, and the primarly goal is to follow certain rules and try new things, but we feel compeled to inform the code can easily stop working because of that.

Other than that, we are happy of the work we did as a team, and our final product. The improvements mentioned are the ones we will take to our professional life, so we are grateful to have made these mistakes in this type of enviroment.
